      const article = `Why Hunter in the Snow Proves Deckard Right
By Emily Strong

Hunter in the Snow by Theodore Buchalter is a poorly written novel filled to the brim with cliche and Landdersonnian colonialist propaganda, but it is adored throughout the East Curve and by me in particular thanks to Buchalters ability to beautifully describe the simple warmth of pure love and kindness. In a book filled with wretched displays of over-described violence and love scenes based on magical misconceptions* it is a wonder that it managed to take off throughout Landdersonne, Cadasia, Vuerith, and even Vol’Kiet. I believe this is because underneath all of Buchalters amateur schlock there is a fundamental truth which resonated throughout the East Curve. That being the Deckardian philosophy "No Good Deed Rights Wrongs Past Done." 

To understand how such a poorly written novel could investigate such a resounding truth first you must understand the novel. In Hunter in the Snow main character Yvette de Blume of the fictional de Blume noble house is set to marry Harry Schwert of the fictional Schwert family. Upon her carriage ride across the country she is beset by a group of orcs who kill her servants and kidnap her, taking her to the mountain cave in which they live. 

Yvette is man-handled by the orcs, who are portrayed as hedonistic and senseless savages, and only when she is about to be ravaged is she then saved by the half-orc runt Press. Press intervenes as a voice of reason, telling his fellow orcs that by her dress he can tell she is noble and that they can ransom her for gold, weapons, and more beautiful women. It is of disgusting note that I say that the orcs only agree to this upon being told they can trade one beautiful woman in for many “sexed up big boob whores.” Forgive the unacademic language, there is a point to eventually be made. 

As Press organises the ransom, Yvette begins to befriend him, seeing a “man-like kindness” behind his eyes. The book carries on this way for many many chapters, with Press trying to herd his tribe while Yvette cultivates what eventually becomes a romance. However, it is the end of the book in which we find our nugget of truth. The plans Press made to ransom Yvette off turn out to be a trap. Harry, who was leading the ransom negotiations, made sure all warriors would be present at a 3rd location upon the time of the switch before sending in a platoon of warriors to kill those innocents left behind. The orcs, Press included, furious at this atrocity fight the noble warriors, but are defeated for there are too many. What I find most tragically beautiful is Yvette's moment of realisation upon seeing Press be brutally slaughtered, that the supposed “man-like kindness” behind his eyes was simply kindness. He was not kind for his human heritage nor was he violent for his orc. It is proven here that Orcs can be kind and Man can be cruel. Upon this realisation, Yvette, who it is now revealed had fallen pregnant with Press’ child, leaves the nobles to live a quiet life in a frontier town.

Deckard supported a similar sentiment for his entire philosophical career. Deckard believed that it was not the soul which influenced your actions but your actions which influenced your soul, or as Buchalter  puts it, “kindness, I see now, was never an innate facet of Press’ humanity, rather a choice he made every day.” This understanding is why Yvette rejects the noble life she could have with Harry, because she knows that fundamentally he is a man tainted by his cruel actions, but also why Yvette rejects the orcish lifestyle she was taught throughout the course of the novel*. Yvette learns that she is pure because she chose to be pure, not because of her noble heritage or her religious fidelity and chooses to protect her purity by rejecting both societies and the cruelness found within them.


In conclusion please don’t read Hunter in the Snow even if its connection to Deckardian philosophy is awesome. It is filled to the brim with problematic depictions of Orcs and Druidic magic as well as not allowing its heroine to ever make a choice until the very end.






*Buchalter portrayed the druidic spell known as Primal Savagery as a “performance enhancing spell” which could alter one in ways unfeasibly thanks to the acidic nature of the spell making it unfit as a procreation aid. 

*I left out the many sections in which Yvette is trained in “womanly tasks” which in one of the more gratuitous sections of the novel included her learning how to properly pleasure a man via the use of a wooden model.
